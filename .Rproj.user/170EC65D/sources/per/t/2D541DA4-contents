summary: 'Zero inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson model: An application to cross-sectional Microbiome data.'
abstract: 'In this study, we addressed challenges in constructing regression models for microbiome count data, specifically focusing on the zero inflation issue. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of the Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Model (ZINB) and the Zero Inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson Model (ZICMP) in handling cross-sectional microbiome data. Utilizing a dataset from a study at NIMHANS with 60 subjects, including drug-naïve or risperidone-treated Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, we applied both models to 16s ribosomal RNA gene sequence-based microbiome data. Evaluation based on criteria such as Akaike Information Criteria, Vuong’s Test, and Rootogram plots revealed comparable performance of the ZINB and ZICMP models, with similar AIC values (190.5) and closely matched Root Mean Squared Error values (288.56 for ZINB and 288.67 for ZICMP). These findings suggest that both models offer similar predictive accuracy for the analyzed microbiome dataset, highlighting their comparable utility in handling zero inflation and overdispersion.'
