## 74th Annual Conference of Indian Society of Agricultural Statistics

First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude to the ISAS society for organizing such a wonderful conference. It provided an excellent opportunity to interact with eminent professors and explore the latest research happening in the field of agriculture, particularly the advancements in AI and machine learning. These innovations are proving to be invaluable in various aspects of agricultural practices.
