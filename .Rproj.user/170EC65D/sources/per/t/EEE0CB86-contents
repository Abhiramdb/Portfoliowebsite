## 17th ISCR Annual conference of Indian Society for Clinical Research

I recall being the sole student delegate amidst attendees from various top-tier pharmaceutical companies from around the world. It was a remarkable experience being surrounded by individuals with diverse perspectives. Each company showcased their work through stalls and exhibitions, shedding light on their ongoing studies and achievements. It was a fantastic opportunity to engage with professionals at an industrial level.

I was fortunate to meet and present in front of esteemed individuals, receiving the second prize for the poster presentation I had prepared. This recognition was truly gratifying and motivated me to continue my academic pursuits with even greater enthusiasm.
