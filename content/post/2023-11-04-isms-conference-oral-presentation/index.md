## ISMSCON-2023 
I extend my sincere gratitude to the [Indian Society for Medical Statistics (ISMS)](https://www.isms-ind.org/) and [Mahatma Gandhi University, Kerala](https://vit.ac.in/school-bio-sciences-technology-sbst/indian-conference-bioinformatics-2023-inbix23) for orchestrating a truly enriching National Conference. The event brought together a diverse array of researchers in the field of biostatistics from various corners of India.

I express heartfelt appreciation for curating a platform that attracted eminent minds from across the country. The conference proved to be a tapestry of insightful talks and meaningful interactions, fostering a collaborative environment that contributed to the advancement of knowledge in biostatistics. This gathering not only showcased the diversity of perspectives but also facilitated the exchange of valuable insights, making it a memorable and impactful experience for all participants.

## Oral Presentation

**Tittle: Zero inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson model: An application to cross-sectional Microbiome data.**
### Abstract
In this study, we addressed challenges in constructing regression models for microbiome count data, specifically focusing on the zero inflation issue. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of the Zero Inflated Negative Binomial Model (ZINB) and the Zero Inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson Model (ZICMP) in handling cross-sectional microbiome data. Utilizing a dataset from a study at NIMHANS with 60 subjects, including drug-naïve or risperidone-treated Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, we applied both models to 16s ribosomal RNA gene sequence-based microbiome data. Evaluation based on criteria such as Akaike Information Criteria, Vuong’s Test, and Rootogram plots revealed comparable performance of the ZINB and ZICMP models, with similar AIC values (190.5) and closely matched Root Mean Squared Error values (288.56 for ZINB and 288.67 for ZICMP). These findings suggest that both models offer similar predictive accuracy for the analyzed microbiome dataset, highlighting their comparable utility in handling zero inflation and overdispersion.
