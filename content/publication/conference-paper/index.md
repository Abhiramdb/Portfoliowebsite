abstract: 'This study investigates the efficacy of two zero-inflated regression models, namely the Zero
Inflated Negative Binomial Model (ZINB) and the Zero Inflated Conway-Maxwell Poisson Model
(ZICMP), in handling count-based microbiome data characterized by zero inflation. Utilizing a
secondary dataset from a NIMHANS study involving 60 subjects categorized into drug-naïve or
risperidone-treated Schizophrenia patients and healthy controls, the research focuses on 16s
ribosomal RNA (16s rRNA) gene sequence-based exploration of gut microbiome differences as a
potential non-invasive biomarker for Schizophrenia. To address overdispersion and excess zeroes
in the count data, both ZINB and ZICMP models were applied and evaluated based on criteria
such as Akaike Information Criteria (AIC), Vuong’s Test, and Rootogram plots. The results
indicate comparable performance between the two models, with similar AIC values of 190.5, and
negligible differences in Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) values (288.56 for ZINB and 288.67
for ZICMP), suggesting similar predictive accuracy. In conclusion, both ZINB and ZICMP models
exhibit comparable fits and predictive performance for the examined microbiome dataset.'
