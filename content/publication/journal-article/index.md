abstract: 'In the intricate domain of count data analysis, particularly within the context of Microbiome data, this research delves into the challenges researchers face, including zero inflation, dispersion variations, and longitudinal versus cross-sectional data. The study scrutinises the widely used Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Mixed Model (ZINBMMM) and the Zero-Inflated Conway-Maxwell-Poisson Mixed Model (ZICMPMM) for their performance in assessing covariate effects and predictive modelling. Employing a selected taxon from two microbiome count datasets in both cross-sectional and longitudinal scenarios, the evaluation employs metrics such as Vuong’s Test, Rootogram, AIC, and BIC. The analysis of cross- sectional data, particularly regarding Ruminococcus count, reveals evidence of overdispersion and zero inflation. In this context, the ZICMP outperforms the ZINB across multiple metrics. However, it’s noteworthy that Vuong’s test did not establish statistical superiority. In the longitudinal data context, involving Lactobacillus jensenii count for pregnant subjects characterized by underdispersion and zero inflation, ZICMPMM demonstrates superior performance over ZINBMM. In summary, ZICMP stands out as a practical alternative to ZINB in cross-sectional data analysis. Additionally, for longitudinal settings, the use of ZICMPMM is recommended for more robust analysis compared to ZINBMM.'
